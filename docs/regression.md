##### Simple Linear Regression:

**Simple Linear regression** is a linear regression with a single explanatory variable [More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables#Statistics_synonyms). 
This mean is, we use a single independent variable to predict the value of a dependent variable.


##### Multiple Linear Regression:
Here, two or more independent variables are used to predict the value of a dependent variable. The difference between Simple linear and Multiple linear Regression is the number of independent variables.

##### Polynomial Linear Regression:
This is a special case multiple linear Regression where the independents variables have power (exponents)
